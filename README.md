## Problem Statement

A Chinese automobile company, Geely Auto, aims to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to compete with their US and European counterparts. They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors affecting car pricing in the American market. Specifically, they want to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car?
- How well do these variables describe the price of a car?

## Business Goal

The goal of this project is to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. This model will be used by the management to understand how prices vary with different independent variables. The insights gained from the model will help the management in making informed decisions regarding car design, business strategy, pricing strategy, etc., to meet certain price levels and understand the pricing dynamics of the new market.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains a large collection of different types of cars across the American market.

## Approach

- Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distribution of data.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Feature Selection: Identify significant variables that influence car prices.
- Model Building: Build machine learning models to predict car prices using selected features.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
- Model Interpretation: Interpret the results to understand how well the selected variables describe the price of a car.
